How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It was much easier to see the bug because the two version differences were stacked on top of one another and I could compair them quickly.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I could go back through and see how things have changed and discover issues or things I liked before that I took out.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: lots of control over what and where the saves happen
Cons: Could forget and have to refer back to a very old version instead

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

Systems like Git are designed for developers who are creating large projects and Google Docs is designed for vanilla users who only work on one page at a time.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

I use git log to pull up all of the commits for that file or set of files. I can then use git diff to see what changes were made between two commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

I would be much more cofident to try new things and tweak things a bit if I knew I had a life line to pull back to incase something got broken.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

I want to use Git as a way to collaborate with my partners and to start creating themes and files for my own custom WordPress installs.
