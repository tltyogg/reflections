When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with a group on a project or when working on different computers on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I'm working on something with another person I may not want to update with their files right away.
