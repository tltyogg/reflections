When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with a group on a project or when working on different computers on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I'm working on something with another person I may not want to update with their files right away.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is used to copy another user's repository on GitHub, a clone copies a repository onto a local computer from GitHub or from a local repository, and a branch is separate set of commits off of the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Knowing the last known state will help when merging. If I know what mine looks like then I will know what changes and differences show up when we try to merge.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

I would probably use DropBox. It would be easier because it's much less technical and easier to understand right away but it would be much harder to see the differences and issues when trying to merge two different sets of code together.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

If I'm making a difference that needs approval then I would need to make a branch and then do a pull request to get those difference ok'd and merged into the master branch.
