When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When working with a group on a project or when working on different computers on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

If I'm working on something with another person I may not want to update with their files right away.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

A fork is used to copy another user's repository on GitHub, a clone copies a repository onto a local computer from GitHub or from a local repository, and a branch is separate set of commits off of the master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Knowing the last known state will help when merging. If I know what mine looks like then I will know what changes and differences show up when we try to merge.
