What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the Git files so that we can start saving commits

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is the place where you can group files together in order to commit them all together. It is very helpful because then you know that only those files have been updated and don't have to worry about the other files in the folder.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

You could only move files that are being updated so you will know if you have one change or too many to commit at a time.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

It might be nice to have a branch for trial runs of programs or sites. Or even different options for a client or partner to look at and approve.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

It's nice to put it out there visually and to see where everything fits together.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

Merging two branches actually merges the secondary branch onto the master branch. This way we can still go back and connect to all of the previous commits on both branches.
